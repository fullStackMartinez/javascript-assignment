		<p id="taco">Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Carne asada on corn tortillas. Ooh, with diced onions and a pinch of cilantro. It’s taco Tuesday Monday. 50 cent tacos! I’ll take 30. Say taco one more time. Add in a few el Pastor with guac and diced onions.</p>
		<p id="chile">Shrimp tacos are tasty tacos! Tacos, tacos, tacos. Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins.</p>
		<p>Add in a few el Pastor with guac and diced onions. Josh’s taco shack is the best taco shack. It’s raining tacos, from out of the sky, tacos, don’t even ask why.</p>
